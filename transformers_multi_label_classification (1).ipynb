        " - We will be creating a neural network with the `BERTClass`. \n",
        " - This network will have the `Bert` model.  Follwed by a `Droput` and `Linear Layer`. They are added for the purpose of **Regulariaztion** and **Classification** respectively. \n",
        " - In the forward loop, there are 2 output from the `BertModel` layer.\n",
        " - The second output `output_1` or called the `pooled output` is passed to the `Drop Out layer` and the subsequent output is given to the `Linear layer`. \n",
        " - Keep note the number of dimensions for `Linear Layer` is **6** because that is the total number of categories in which we are looking to classify our model.\n",
        " - The data will be fed to the `BertClass` as defined in the dataset. \n",
        " - Final layer outputs is what will be used to calcuate the loss and to determine the accuracy of models prediction. \n",
        " - We will initiate an instance of the network called `model`. This instance will be used for training and then to save the final trained model for future inference. \n",
        " \n",
        "#### Loss Function and Optimizer\n",
        " - The Loss is defined in the next cell as `loss_fn`.\n",
        " - As defined above, the loss function used will be a combination of Binary Cross Entropy which is implemented as [BCELogits Loss](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#bcewithlogitsloss) in PyTorch\n",
        " - `Optimizer` is defined in the next cell.\n",
        " - `Optimizer` is used to update the weights of the neural network to improve its performance.\n",
        " \n",
        "#### Further Reading\n",
